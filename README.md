## Overview

Logos Flow is a research project exploring a novel approach to language modeling based on **Concept-Driven Reinforcement Learning Agents (CDRLAs)**. Instead of operating at the token level like traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), Logos Flow operates on **concepts**, represented by multilingual and multimodal sentence embeddings. This allows for:

*   **Abstract Reasoning:** Modeling the underlying reasoning process, not just surface-level language patterns.
*   **Multilingual & Multimodal Generalization:** Leveraging a shared semantic space (currently based on a modified version of [SONAR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SONAR) embeddings) to process and generate text (and potentially speech and other modalities) across many languages.
*   **Improved Long-Range Coherence:** Facilitating the generation of longer, more coherent text through concept-level planning.
*   **Efficient Handling of Long Contexts:** Processing sequences of concepts, which are significantly shorter than token sequences.

This repository contains a **lightweight, resource-efficient implementation** of a CDRLA, designed for experimentation and development on machines with limited computational resources (e.g., a personal laptop).

**Note:** This project is under active development. Expect changes and improvements as we continue our research.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

*   Python 3.9+
*   A machine with limited resources (e.g. a laptop with CPU only is sufficient to start)

**Installation:**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/artbyoscar/LogosFlow.git](https://github.com/artbyoscar/LogosFlow.git)  # Replace with your repository URL
    cd LogosFlow
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

**Data Preparation:**

1.  **Choose a Dataset:**
    *   For initial experiments, we recommend the **ROC Stories** dataset, which is small and well-suited for testing coherence. You can also use a small subset of **CNN/DailyMail** for summarization tasks or create a tiny **manually curated dataset** for initial testing.

2.  **Preprocess the Data:**
    *   Run the `preprocess.py` script to segment the chosen dataset into sentences, encode them into embeddings, and save them to the `data/` directory.
        ```bash
        python preprocess.py
        ```
    *   **Note:** You may need to adjust the `dataset_name` and `split` arguments in `preprocess.py` depending on the dataset you choose.

**Training:**

1.  **Train the Model:**

    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

    *   This script trains a simple version of the LCM model using the preprocessed embeddings.
    *   You can adjust hyperparameters in `train.py`.
    *   Model checkpoints will be saved to the `models/` directory (you might need to create it if it does not exist yet).

**Generation:**

1.  **Generate Text:**

    ```bash
    python generate.py
    ```

    *   This script loads a trained model and generates text based on a given prompt.
    *   You can modify the `prompt` and other generation parameters in `generate.py`.

**Testing:**

1.  **Run Unit Tests:**

    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover tests
    ```
    This command discovers and runs all tests within the `tests` directory.

## Experimentation and Development

*   **Model Architecture:** Explore different model architectures in `model.py`. Start with the `SimplePolicyNetwork` and experiment with variations (e.g., number of layers, hidden size, LSTM/GRU/Transformer).
*   **Training Parameters:** Adjust hyperparameters in `train.py` (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs).
*   **Reward Function:** Implement different reward functions in `reward.py` (when you get to the RL phase).
*   **Search Algorithms:** (Optional) Implement basic search algorithms (e.g., beam search) in `search.py`.
*   **Quantization:** (Optional) Explore quantization techniques to reduce model size and memory usage.
*   **Hierarchical Structure:** (Optional) Experiment with hierarchical planning by adding topic embeddings or other higher-level representations.
